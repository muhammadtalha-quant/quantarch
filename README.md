# My OWN Dotfiles for Hyprland + Noctalia v5 + ArchLinux

## Installation
Following steps should be followed to install these configs. Unlike other configs where you install an OS and then install the config, this is a bit different, this config ships with `archinstall` json configs for quick and effortless install.

### Step 1
- Boot into already flashed archlinux live usb {minimal}
- Connect to wifi with `iwctl station wlan<id> connect <network-name>`, leave if you are connected with ethernet.
- To find your wlan id, type `iwctl station list`
- To find your network (just in case), type `iwctl station wlan<id> get-networks`
- After you connect to wifi, test your connection with `ping -c 5 google.com`
- Then after that run `sudo pacman -Sy archinstall archlinux-keyring git jq` to refresh package database for pacman and install some pre-requisites for the dotfile installation. 

### Step 2
- Clone the repository into the live session by `git clone https://github.com/muhammadtalha-quant/dotfiles.git`.
- Change directory to the freshly cloned repo with `cd dotfiles`
- Run `lsblk` and find your storage device node to which you want to install archlinux. 
- Run `jq '.hostname |= "host-name-of-your-choice" | .disk_config.device_modifications.[0].device |= "/dev/<target-device>"' config_template.json > config.json` to change your hostname and the target disk for installation.
- Run `jq '.encryption_password |= "disk-encryption-password-of-your-choice" | ."!root-password" |= "root-password-of-your-choice" | .users.[0]."!password" |= "user-password-of-your-choice" | .users.[0].username |= "username-of-your-choice"' creds_template.json > creds.json` to change username, disk encryption password, password for the root user and password for the normal user.

> [!CAUTION]
> Keep the passwords memorable, keep them somewhere safe, write them in your mobile notepad app. If you lost these passwords and got locked out of your PC or your important data is lost then don't blame me.

### Step 3
- Run `archinstall --config config.json --creds creds.json` to begin the unattended installation of arch linux.
- When the installation is completed, select reboot to restart your system..

> [!NOTE]
> This will install minimal arch linux with hyprland on top.

### Step 4
- Open terminal using the key shown in hyprland generated message bar in the top.
- Run `chsh -s $(which fish)` to change shell from bash to fish.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/muhammadtalha-quant/dotfiles.git` to clone the dotfile repository again.
- Change directory to the freshly cloned repo with `cd dotfiles`
- Run `./bootstrap.fish` and then sit and provide password when prompted.
- After the process is complete, reboot your system by running `sudo systemctl reboot` to see the final changes.
